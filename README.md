## Project Vision

UMEBOT is more than just a robot; it is the technological symbol of UMECIT University and a piece of engineering with enormous potential. It was born with a vision: to transform the university into a pioneer in teaching with autonomous robots, with the ultimate goal that UMEBOT can become a robotic professor.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as the central documentation and visualization of the UMEBOT experimental prototype. Its primary purpose is twofold:

* **Foundation for the Future:** To serve as a solid codebase and architectural foundation upon which future implementations and improvements of the robot can be built.
* **Technical Reference:** To act as a case study and a detailed technical reference for other students, developers, or researchers interested in service robotics, conversational AI, and complex system integration.

For a complete and detailed understanding of the project, it is highly recommended to consult the comprehensive documentation hosted on Google Drive.
